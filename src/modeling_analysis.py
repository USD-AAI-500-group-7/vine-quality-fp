    ********************************************   Interpretation of the Model Performance   ********************************************
    Red Wine Performance:
        R-Squared Score:  0.38
        RMSE:  0.61

    White Wine Performance: 
        R-squared Score: 0.32
        RMSE: 0.61

                                                                R-Squared:                                                         
        R-squared indicates the degree to which the model accounts for the variability in wine quality.
        Therefore, an R-squared value of 0.38 for red wine indicates that 38% of the variation in red wine quality can be explained by the model. 
        We can say that this is a moderate performance, and it nearly indicates that other factors affecting wine quality are absent from our model.

        For white wine, our R-squared score is 0.32, indicating that 32% of the variation in white wine quality is explained by the model. 
        This suggests that the model has more difficulty with white wine compared to red wine.


        A higher R-squared (closer to 1.0) indicates a better model, but as it decreases from 1.0 and becomes lower, we say the model isnâ€™t capturing enough of the variation.




                                                                RMSE:                                         
        RMSE shows the average difference between actual and predicted wine quality scores.
        The results show that both models have an RMSE of 0.61, indicating that on average, our predicted wine quality score deviates by 0.61 units.
        A lower RMSE indicates better performance, as it reflects that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.




                                                         Analysis of performance:
        We have moderate performance with Red Wine, but lower performance with White Wine.


    Red Wine:
        The model has nearly done a good job predicting red wine quality, explaining 38% of the variation in quality scores. However, the RMSE indicates moderate errors in predictions, yet we can consider it reasonable for a dataset like this. 

    White Wine:
        The model here struggles because it only explains 32% of the variation. As a result, we can conclude that we are missing some important variables that more significantly affect the quality of white wine, and these variables are not included in the dataset. The RMSE result with red wine is the same. 

    Scatter plots:
        The scatter plot comparing actual and predicted quality indicates that the predictions are widely dispersed, suggesting that the model does not perfectly match the actual values. 
        In an ideal model, all points would lie on the diagonal black line (y = x). However, in our model, this is not the case, as many points deviate from the line, indicating that the model is imperfect in predicting quality.


    Refining the model:
        To improve the model, we can apply data scaling and transformation. We can normalize or standardize the features to enhance the model's performance, or we can utilize a generalized linear model(GLM).

    Conclusion:
        We can say the model is somewhat useful for predicting the quality of wine, particularly for red wine, although it doesn't account for wine quality since we lack other factors that may influence it. Those factors are not included in the dataset.
